              <h3><b><h2>Excise policy case: SC to deliver its verdict on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's plea against arrest today</h2></b>
                Friday is an extremely important day for Arvind Kejriwal, with the Supreme Court set to deliver its judgment on a plea filed by the Delhi chief minister challenging the legality of his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in its money laundering investigation related to the larger Delhi liquor policy case.
The apex court reserved its verdict on the plea by Kejriwal, who is represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, on May 17. The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) national convenor was arrested by the ED on March 21, having skipped all nine summons sent by the federal agency.

                As the 2025 Champions Trophy finds itself in a state of limbo following India's reported stance of not travelling to Pakistan, former captain Shahid Afridi has urged the BCCI to think otherwise. Afridi wants India to come and play in Pakistan, as it will not just help the cricketing ties between two nations grow but also give the crowd in his country the opportunity to witness Virat Kohli play.

Bilateral cricketing ties between India and Pakistan have been put on hold since 2013. Pakistan recently visited India for last year's 50-overs World Cup, and for the longest time, it was believed that India would return the favour by going and playing in Pakistan.

              </b>
                With no formal coaching experience—Gautam Gambhir has only worked as a mentor with two IPL franchises—and a professional retirement as late as 2019, how did Gambhir become BCCI's choice as India's new head coach? The popular notion is that his role in helping Kolkata Knight Riders win the IPL after a decade-long wait did the trick. The KKR players and the support staff were vocal about Gambhir's role in creating the perfect team environment. True, but that hardly mattered to the BCCI.

Hindustan Times has learnt that Gambhir’s elevation to India’s head coach position had been in the works for months. It wouldn’t have mattered if KKR hadn’t won the IPL title.

              </b>
                Donald Trump seized the opportunity to mock President Joe Biden's slip-up during his 'Big Boy' press conference. Following Biden's earlier gaffe of mistakenly referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as 'President Putin', the POTUS sparked another round of internet mockery with yet another embarrassing moment. As he began to take questions, the president stumbled almost immediately. This time, Biden left the crowd baffled by referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as 'Trump'. “Look, I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if I think she’s not qualified to be president,” Biden said. The President was said to be discussing concerns regarding Vice President Kamala Harris's capacity to win against Donald Trump should she be the main contender.</h3>

                    "Eighth wonder of the world". "Once in a generation". "Cheat code". Jasprit Bumrah has got many nicknames in the Indian dressing room. But perhaps the biggest indicator of his greatness is his ability to impart knowledge, even to coaches and seniors who have been associated with the game for decades. Jasprit Bumrah is an institution not just in fast bowling but cricket, in general. The way he thinks about the game, the way he wants to learn, unlearn and keep growing as a cricketer are remarkable. A chat with Bumrah before and after the game is a tutorial in itself.</h3>
